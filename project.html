                <h2>Project Name: Bodycare Junkie Website</h2>
                <h3>What products are sold?:</h3>
                <p>Natural bath and body products such as soaps, bath bombs, shower steamers etc. </p>
                <h3>Target users:</h3>
                <p>General public, mainly target audience is women of all ages. Users might be on mobile or desktop, 
                   but most users are likely to be on mobile.</p>
                <h3>Static Information:</h3>
                <p>Obviously, we want to display the company name and along with that a contact page would be nice, one where you can display the company phone number, 
                   email link, and links to other social media pages.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Elements:</h3>
                <p>Overall look should be a more calming aesthetic with no overly bright colours or sharp animations. It would be preferred 
                   for the website to have an uncluttered, simplified design, and overall be user friendly allowing for people to navigate easily.
                </p>
                <h3>Data:</h3>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of the website is to simply display the company products and associated data. This includes pictures of the product, 
                    ingredients and how to use details, and pricing. 
                </p>
                <h3>Simple interactive elements:</h3>
                <p> 
                    There aren't necessarily any tools or games needed, however, interactive features such as a drop down or collapsing menu as well as 
                    animations or functionality to display multiple images of the same product would be nice.
                </p>
